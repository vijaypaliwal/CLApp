Linea Device plugin for phonegap


This is now an open-source project! I decided this project has made it's money from private enterprises and it was time to release into the public.

Documentation can be found here:

This project is "AS IS" and comes with no warranty, bla bla bla legal stuff (read the LICENSE file for full license).

If you'd like to contract me to help with setup/installation/changes and/or getting it on the app store please feel free to contact me either here in github or via the form from the link above.
